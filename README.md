### **Project Title**:
**E-commerce Sales and Profitability Analysis for Retail Operations**

### **Project Introduction**:
This project showcases my ability to analyze transactional data in the context of e-commerce retail operations. Using a dataset with columns such as **Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer Name, Segment, State, Country, Market, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, Shipping Cost, Order Priority, and Year**, I performed a comprehensive analysis to uncover key insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and profitability.

The goal was to generate actionable business insights to help drive decisions in marketing, inventory management, and operational efficiency. Using tools such as **Excel Pivot Tables**, **Power Query**, and **Data Visualization**, I transformed raw data into meaningful metrics, visualizations, and strategic recommendations that can help optimize business performance.


### **Project Objective**:
The primary goal of this project was to analyze sales data and uncover actionable insights that would help answer the following key business questions:
1. Which product categories and sub-categories are generating the highest revenue and profit?
2. How do discounts affect profitability, and which segment of customers are benefiting the most from them?
3. What are the sales trends by region, market, and customer segment, and how do they influence inventory management?
4. How does shipping cost impact profitability, and which shipping modes are most cost-effective?
5. What is the relationship between order priority and customer satisfaction, and how can it be optimized?

### **Project Scope**:
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed data to understand key drivers of sales, profit, and customer behavior.
- **Metrics Creation**: Developed business metrics like **Total Sales**, **Profit Margin**, **Discount Impact**, and **Order Priority Impact**.
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Broke down performance by **Segment, Region, Market, and Product Category** to identify growth opportunities.
- **Shipping & Cost Analysis**: Investigated shipping cost optimization and its relationship with profitability.
- **Data Visualization**: Used **PivotTables**, **Charts**, and **Dashboards** to present findings in a visually compelling and easy-to-understand format.

### **Methodology**:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - I began by importing and reviewing the data to ensure it was complete and clean.
   - Using **Power Query**, I transformed the data, handling missing values,creating calculated columns, data type formatting and categorizing information where necessary.

2. **Metrics Creation**:
   I derived key metrics to measure the business performance:
   - **Total Sales** = `Sales * Quantity`
   - **Profit Margin** = `Profit / Sales * 100`
   - **Total Discount** = `Sales * Discount`
   - **Total Profit** = `Profit`
   - **Shipping Cost Impact** = `Sales - Shipping Cost`
   - **Discount Impact on Profit**: I compared sales with and without discounts to see how much the discount was impacting the profit margins.
   
3. **Segmentation and Analysis**:
   - Analyzed sales performance by **Customer Segment**, **Region**, **Market**, and **Product Category** to uncover which areas are performing best and which need improvement.
   - Focused on understanding how **Order Priority** (e.g., high vs. low priority) impacts shipping speed, customer satisfaction, and profitability.

4. **Shipping and Cost Optimization**:
   - Investigated the relationship between **Shipping Mode** and **Shipping Cost** to determine the most cost-effective shipping options.
   - Evaluated the **Shipping Cost** in relation to total sales and profit margins to identify areas for improvement.

5. **Trend Analysis**:
   - **Yearly Trends**: I analyzed the data by **Year** to identify sales growth trends, fluctuations, and patterns over time.
   - Created visualizations to highlight key insights, such as **Sales by Region**, **Profit by Product Category**, and **Discounts and Their Effect on Profit**.

6. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created interactive **Pivot Tables** to analyze data across different dimensions (e.g., by **Region, Market, Product Category**).
   - Developed **charts and dashboards** to visually communicate trends, key metrics, and comparisons.

### **Key Findings**:
1. **Top Performing Products**: The analysis revealed that certain product categories and sub-categories were responsible for the majority of sales and profit. By focusing on these high-performing areas, the business can prioritize inventory and marketing efforts.
2. **Impact of Discounts**: Discounts were shown to drive more sales, but they often reduced the overall profit margin. Certain segments (e.g., **Consumer** and **Corporate**) benefited more from discounts, while others had a lower impact on profitability.
3. **Shipping Cost Optimization**: There was a noticeable discrepancy in the **Shipping Cost** vs. profit margin for different shipping modes. Using **Standard Shipping** proved more cost-effective compared to **Express Shipping**, which incurred higher shipping costs.
4. **Regional Performance**: Some regions outperformed others, with **North America** and **Europe** generating the highest revenue. This can be useful for targeting marketing campaigns and optimizing supply chain logistics.
5. **Order Priority**: **High-priority orders** tended to have a faster shipping time but at a higher cost. The project revealed the opportunity to streamline **shipping strategies** based on priority levels to balance customer satisfaction and profitability.

### **Deliverables**:
1. **Data Report**: A detailed analysis report summarizing key findings, such as sales trends, product performance, shipping costs, and profitability.
2. **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly dashboard highlighting the most critical metrics, including total sales, profit, discount impact, and shipping cost breakdown.
3. **Strategic Recommendations**: A set of actionable recommendations based on the analysis, including:
   - Optimizing shipping strategies to reduce costs
   - Focusing marketing efforts on high-performing product categories
   - Adjusting discount strategies to improve profitability without losing customers
4. **Trend Analysis**: Year-over-year comparisons, segmented by market, region, and product category, to inform future business decisions.
